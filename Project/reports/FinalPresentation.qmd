# The Data & Initial Plan

## Dataset Context

- Parquet dataset of Oregon digital ad auctions
    - Each row represents **a single line bid within a Prebid Auction**.
    - The Prebid server handles online ad auctions where multiple bidders submit CPM bids.
    - Each auction can have multiple bidders and each bidder may bid on multiple sizes.
    - Each row corresponds to **one bidder's response for one size within an auction**.
- Includes timestamps, geolocation, device info, publisher data  
- Contains intentionally inserted data-quality issues  

## Guiding Questions (examples)

- What patterns appear across time, device type, and geography?  
- How does missingness or inconsistency affect analysis?  
- What behaviors or trends characterize Oregon's ad ecosystem?  

## Why These Questions Matter (examples)

- Ethical concerns around targeting and bias  
- Interpretability and decision-making  
- Understanding data reliability and uncertainty

::: notes
Professor's requirement (Section 2):
- Basic data set context
- Guiding questions we developed
- Why these guiding questions matter
- The roles you assigned within the team and how you coordinated work:
    – GitHub workflow (branches, pull requests, commits)
    – Jira/Kanban tasks, deadlines, progress tracking
    - NOTE: Roles/coordination will be detailed in the next slide group
Target: under 5 minutes total.
