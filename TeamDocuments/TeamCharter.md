**Meeting Expectations**

  - Members must come prepared with:
      - Updates on completed work
      - Blockers (if any)
      - Proposed next steps or solutions
      - Requests from team (if any)
  - Unprepared attendance stalls progress — preparation is required for every meeting.

### Pull Request & Review Rules (GitHub Only)

  - Work is completed on **personal feature branches**
      - Branch naming: `<name>/<task>`
      - Example: `etoobian/add-eda-plots`
  - Branches should represent **one small, complete task** and be merged back before starting new work  
  (avoid long-running or multi-feature branches)
  - **Never commit directly to `main`**
  - Merging into `main` requires a **Pull Request**
  - Every PR must include review from:
      - **At least one reviewer who is not the author**
      - **Anyone working on or depending on the same code area**
  - Reviews use GitHub review options: **Approve / Request Changes / Comment**
  - Keep Code reviews constructive.
  - All review comments must be addressed before merging. 
  - If commits are added after approval, a **re-review must be requested**.

### Definition of Done (for all tasks)

A task is “Done” when it is:

  - [] Tested and Documented
  - [] Data transformations recorded
  - [] Pushed to GitHub  
  - [] Submitted via Pull Request  
  - [] Reviewed and approved  
  - [] Merged into `main`  
  - [] Reflected on the Kanban board  
  - [] Free of merge conflicts

  - Pull requests are reviewed within 48 hours (Unless discussed otherwise)
